  "tivo_artist_name": "Kenny Drew",
  "bio": [
    "A talented bop-based pianist (whose son has been one of the brightest pianists of the 1990s), Kenny Drew was somewhat underrated due to his decision to permanently move to Copenhagen in 1964. He made his recording debut in 1949 with Howard McGhee and in the 1950s was featured on sessions with a who's who of jazz, including Charlie Parker, Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, Milt Jackson, Buddy DeFranco's quartet, Dinah Washington, and Buddy Rich (1958). Drew led sessions for Blue Note, Norgran, Pacific Jazz, Riverside, and the obscure Judson label during 1953-1960; most of the sessions are available on CD. He moved to Paris in 1961 and relocated to Copenhagen in 1964 where he was co-owner of the Matrix label. He formed a duo with Niels-Henning Orsted Pederson and worked regularly at the Montmartre. Drew recorded many dates for SteepleChase in the 1970s and remained active up until his death.",
    "The late Kenny Drew was one of the finest, most durable and tasteful mainstream pianists from the 1950s through the early â€˜90s. Drew played with several major performers, including Lester Young, Dinah Washington, and Dexter Gordon. While he had several albums under his own name, Drew was best known as an accompanist, perhaps because of his relocation to Denmark in 1964. He often performed with legendary bassist Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen in duo and group contexts. His son, Kenny Drew Jr., is also a fine pianist."
